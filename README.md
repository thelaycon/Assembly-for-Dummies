# Assembly-for-Dummies
Learn assembly for the x86-64 architecture from the first principles.

Hey, let's learn Assembly for x86-64. I'll be updating these repo with chapters on it. Do stick around.

## 🎒 Prerequisites
1.  A computer running **Linux** (or WSL on Windows, or macOS).
2.  A text editor (VS Code, Vim, Nano, or a steady hand and a magnet).
3.  **NASM** (The Assembler) and **GCC/LD** (The Linker).

### Installing Tools
**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nasm build-essential
```
**Arch Linux:**

sudo pacman -S nasm base-devel
```
